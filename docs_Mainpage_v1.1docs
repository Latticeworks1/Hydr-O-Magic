1. Introduction

The Hydro-Matic Map Application is a web-based mapping tool designed to assist users in creating, managing, and analyzing geographical data related to hydrological projects. This documentation provides a detailed guide on how to use and customize the Hydro-Matic map application for various projects.
2. Project Overview

The Hydro-Matic map application is built using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and Plotly.js. It allows users to:

    Create and manage projects.
    Add and customize markers on the map.
    Export project data in JSON format.
    Visualize elevation data using a contour plot.
    Switch between different map layers.

3. Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run the Hydro-Matic map application, you'll need the following:

    A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
    PyCharm IDE (Optional but recommended for development).
    A server environment (e.g., Linode VPS) to host the application.

Installation

    Clone or download the Hydro-Matic repository from GitHub.

    Host the application on your server.

    Open the application in your web browser.

4. Usage

    The exported file will include project details and marker data.

Contour Plot

    Click the "Show Contour Plot" button to open a modal with a contour plot of elevation data.
    The contour plot updates based on map zoom and move events.

5. Project Data Management

    All project data, including markers and project details, is stored in local storage.
    You can clear local storage to start fresh or load project data from JSON files.

6. Advanced Features
